        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p class="about">I’m Julia and I was born and raised in Beverly, Massachusetts, a small suburb just outside of Boston. I graduated from Beverly High School in June of 2016, and enrolled in the <a href="https://www.umass.edu">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> for my undergraduate degree. I’m now a junior at UMass studying English with a concentration in <a href="http://www.umass.edu/pwtc/">Professional Writing and Technical Communication.</a> I also work in the university’s <a href="https://www.umass.edu/writingcenter/">Writing Center</a> as a peer tutor. When I graduate in May of 2020, I hope to work in a writing-based profession. Right now I’m considering careers in technical writing, grant writing, content strategy and development, and copywriting.<br> Take a look at my <a href="resume.html">resume</a> to learn more about my skills and experiences!</p>
